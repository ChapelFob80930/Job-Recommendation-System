# Job Recommendation System 🧑‍💼

Welcome to the Job Recommendation System developed during the Hackathon at Alliance University! This project leverages advanced AI algorithms to intelligently match job seekers with suitable job listings based on their resumes.

## Key Features ✨

- **Intelligent Job Matching** 🕵️‍♂️
  - Our system runs intelligent queries to scan through job listings and find roles that best match your skills and experience. The AI evaluates your resume against industry requirements, ensuring that you are matched with the most suitable job opportunities.

- **Personalized Skill Improvement Recommendations** 📚
  - Not sure if your skills are up-to-date? The matcher not only finds jobs but also suggests what you can improve. Get course recommendations from trusted platforms like Udemy and Coursera to enhance your skill set.

- **Actionable Insights** 📈
  - Beyond just matching jobs, our tool provides detailed insights into your resume's strengths and weaknesses. With this feedback, you can strategically enhance your skills, tailor your resume, and improve your chances of getting hired.

- **User-Friendly Interface** 💻
  - The platform is built with simplicity in mind. Upload your resume, answer a few questions about your career goals, and let our AI do the heavy lifting. The clean and intuitive interface ensures a smooth user experience.

- **Continuous Updates** 🔄
  - The job market is constantly evolving. Our system regularly updates with the latest job listings and course recommendations to keep you ahead of the curve and ensure you are always equipped with the best opportunities.

## How It Works 🛠️

1. **Upload Your Resume** 📄
   - Start by uploading your resume. Our AI scans and extracts key details regarding your skills, experience, and education.

2. **Job Matching** 🔍
   - The tool queries a wide range of job listings, comparing your resume against current market demands to find the best matches tailored to your unique profile.

3. **Skill Analysis & Improvement Suggestions** 📊
   - After matching, the system assesses your skill set and identifies areas for improvement. It then recommends targeted online courses (e.g., "Python for Machine Learning") from leading learning platforms.
